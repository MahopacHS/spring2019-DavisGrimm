The dictionary will contain the product name, price and quantity. \n\n\nThe program should loop continually,  asking the user to enter \n - Product name\n - Product price\n - Product quantity\n\nuntil the user enters a product name of `'checkout'` at which time the loop should break.\n\nEach time through the loop you should create a dictionary of product name, product price and product quantity then add the dictionary to a list.\n\nAfter you enter `'checkout'`  the program should show:\n\n - all the items in the cart, including their quantity and price\n - and the total amount of the order, a running sum of quantity times price\n\nNOTE: Don't worry about handling bad inputs for this exercise.\n\nExample Run:\n\n```\nE-Commerce Shopping Cart\nEnter product name or 'checkout':pencil\nEnter pencil Price:0.99\nEnter pencil Quantity:10\nEnter product name or 'checkout':calculator\nEnter calculator Price:9.99\nEnter calculator Quantity:1\nEnter product name or 'checkout':checkout\npencil 10 $0.99\ncalculator 1 $9.99\nTOTAL: $19.89\n```\n\nStart out your program by writing your TODO list of steps you'll need to solve the problem!"
